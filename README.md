# learning-lote-go

### Year-end Summary for 2022
I am a bad, failed programmer in 2022.

I lost my job, my lover, and my friends who left me because of my withdrawn personality.

I retaliated by spending all my savings since I started working, and they turned into a few cold machines.

I don't know how to adjust my emotions, maybe only music, fitness and continue to learn more knowledge.

I will improve myself on the basics of golang, common frameworks and algorithmic applications

Hopefully 2023 will be an improvement.
